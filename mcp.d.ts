/**
 * The `mcp` capability — call the viewer's connected MCP tools from inside a frame.
 *
 * One decision, two arms: displaying data that should stay current is
 * `watchTool`; performing an action once is `callTool`. Use `listTools()`
 * to see which servers the viewer has available, and `server(name)` for a
 * handle whose methods are one server's tools. Calls run with the
 * viewer's credentials; your code never sees tokens. Obtain the
 * namespace with `const mcp = await claude.use("mcp")` — `null` means
 * this view cannot run the capability; design for absence. Besides the
 * viewer's connectors, a view may reach Claude's own servers for this
 * artifact (`kind: "artifact"` in `listTools()`; today `artifacts_data`,
 * this artifact's document store, on a page that declared `db`): then
 * `use("mcp")` resolves whatever the connector manifest's state — none
 * declared, or declared but not granted to this viewer.
 */

declare namespace Claude {
  /**
   * Failure design — read before writing any call site. Connector calls
   * fail routinely in normal operation (lapsed auth, a connector the
   * viewer has not added, a briefly unreachable upstream), and each code
   * on {@link Claude.mcp.McpError} has a different correct response.
   * Design the page's degraded states alongside its happy path:
   *
   * - Branch the UX on the error `code`, never on message text, and
   *   never collapse all failures into one generic banner. A single
   *   catch-all ("transient connector failure", "something went wrong")
   *   is the named anti-pattern for this capability: it hides the one
   *   action that would fix the page (reconnect, add the connector,
   *   choose one, or simply wait) and turns recoverable states into
   *   dead ends. A default branch with generic copy is fine for codes
   *   you do not handle individually — the anti-pattern is collapsing
   *   the codes that do have a distinct fix into that one banner.
   * - Retry only errors stamped `retryable: true` (today
   *   `server_unavailable`, `rate_limited` if it ever fires, and the
   *   `upstream_error` a first call gets when the viewer's consent for
   *   that connector could not be asked or was left undecided just now)
   *   — at most once per user-visible refresh, after a short randomized
   *   delay, honoring `retryAfterMs` when present, and ONLY for reads.
   *   `server_unavailable` (the runtime's reply timeout and upstream
   *   5xx land here) and `upstream_error` are AMBIGUOUS outcomes for
   *   writes: a rejection is NOT proof the tool did not run. Re-issue a
   *   write only behind a fresh user gesture, and where the connector
   *   offers a read, re-read state first. Never retry `needs_reauth` or
   *   `server_not_connected` unattended — repeating the call cannot
   *   succeed on its own: `needs_reauth` means credential refresh was
   *   already exhausted upstream, and `server_not_connected` means no
   *   connector is configured at all (for a `host:` server: no host
   *   bridge on this surface, or the local server is not running). Render
   *   their documented reconnect/add or no-host fallback copy instead; a
   *   later viewer action may bring a host server back.
   * - Consent is readable and requestable per connector via the
   *   `permissions` capability's scoped names: `"mcp:<server>"`, with
   *   the server name exactly as declared in the manifest (the same
   *   string passed to {@link Claude.mcp.callTool}). A multi-connector
   *   page should gate each section on its own server's state
   *   (`state("mcp:<server>")`) and ask per section
   *   (`request(["mcp:<server>"])`) rather than asking for everything
   *   up front; bare `"mcp"` remains the whole-manifest aggregate —
   *   "granted" only when every declared server is covered, and asking
   *   it asks for all of them. `use("mcp")` resolving non-`null` is
   *   the availability gate. Any state other
   *   than `"unavailable"` from a permissions read means present, and
   *   `"prompt"` means proceed (the first call asks) — never gate
   *   rendering on `=== "granted"`, and tolerate rejection on any
   *   permissions read (`.catch(() => "unavailable")`). Handle the
   *   lifecycle rejection codes on every call — availability is
   *   per-view and can change across a re-boot.
   * - A tool-level failure REJECTS with `tool_error` (the connector was
   *   reachable and answered, but reported failure) — the full result
   *   envelope rides the rejection's `result` field for the rare
   *   inspector. An immediate retry with the same arguments rarely
   *   helps; surface the reported message in the affected section.
   * - Host servers (`host:<name>`): a manifest entry whose `server`
   *   starts with `host:` names an MCP server running on the VIEWER'S
   *   DEVICE, reached through the Claude app that shows the page (the
   *   desktop app first). `<name>` is the local server's name with
   *   anything outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` replaced by `_`. The API is the
   *   same — `callTool("host:filesystem", "read_file", {...})`, consent
   *   per server via `"mcp:host:filesystem"` — with three differences:
   *   outside the app (a browser tab, an embedded drawer) every call
   *   fails — `server_not_connected` once the shell routes `host:`
   *   calls to the app; the service itself never runs a `host:` tool —
   *   and there `listTools()` then omits the server, so always render a
   *   no-host fallback; the app may ask the viewer to confirm a call
   *   that is not annotated read-only, which can take a while or come
   *   back `cancelled`; and only the Artifact's owner can use host
   *   servers for now. Once the shell routes `host:` calls to the app,
   *   tool input goes to the device rather than the service, which then
   *   sees which tool ran, never its arguments.
   * - Pages that make several calls per refresh (dashboards,
   *   multi-section reports) contain each failure in the section it
   *   affects: one failed call annotates or greys out its own section
   *   while the rest render normally. Keep the previous successful
   *   data visible with a stale/last-updated indicator (drive it from
   *   the result's `cache.storedAt`, never `Date.now()`), and prefer
   *   {@link Claude.mcp.watchTool} for such sections — it replays,
   *   refreshes, and coalesces for you. When every section fails at
   *   once with the same code, treat it as a page-level condition:
   *   show one message with a reload affordance instead of repeating
   *   the same error in every section.
   * - In a {@link Claude.mcp.watchTool} handler: transient errors keep
   *   last-good data; authz denials (`needs_reauth`,
   *   `server_not_connected`, `blocked_by_policy`, `approval_required`)
   *   RETRACT rendered data; registration failures mean no live updates
   *   will ever arrive — full doctrine on {@link Claude.mcp.watchTool}.

     * - `needs_reauth` — connector token expired/revoked. The shell

     *   don't build an always-on reconnect banner; keep a lightweight
     *   in-frame fallback ("Reconnect {server} in claude.ai Settings →
     *   Connectors") for mid-session lapses and dismissed/suppressed
     *   prompts.
     * - `server_not_connected` — no callable connector with this display
     *   name for the current viewer. Also usually pre-empted by the
     *   shell's load-time prompt; in-frame fallback: "Add {server} in
     *   claude.ai Settings → Connectors". For a `host:` server it also
     *   means this surface has no host bridge (not inside the Claude
     *   app) or the local server is not running — render the no-host
     *   fallback; the shell never prompts for these.
     * - `selection_required` — the viewer has more than one callable
     *   connector with this display name and has not yet chosen one. The
     *   shell prompts the viewer to choose at most once per loaded version
     *   of the artifact (a live version update can re-arm one prompt); if
     *   they dismiss the prompt the error can persist. Back off or fall
     *   back to a degraded view, as for `server_not_connected`.
     * - `server_not_found` — resolved server no longer exists upstream.
     * - `server_unavailable` — upstream MCP server unreachable/5xx/timeout;
     *   transient, stamped `retryable: true`.
     * - `not_in_manifest` — `(server, tool)` is outside the frame's
     *   published manifest (a page bug), or outside the scope the viewer
     *   consented to: they turned this connector off for the page, or
     *   declined it when the page's first call on it asked. Render that
     *   connector's section as not allowed for this view; do not re-ask
     *   in a loop.
     * - `blocked_by_policy` — tool is in the manifest but org policy blocks
     *   it for this viewer.
     * - `approval_required` — org policy requires per-call approval for
     *   this tool and none was given; per-call approval is not yet
     *   supported in artifacts. Not retryable without viewer action;
     *   render a "needs approval" degraded state. (Older runtimes
     *   degrade this code to `upstream_error` per the unknown-code
     *   rule.)
     * - `tool_error` — the tool ran but reported failure. The call
     *   REJECTS with this code; the full envelope rides the rejection's
     *   `result`. (Tool failures no longer resolve with an `isError`
     *   flag.)
     * - `bad_request` — caller bug: `server`/`tool` not strings, `input`
     *   not JSON-serializable (or arguments not structured-cloneable),
     *   a duplicate watch registration, the per-view watch limit (64 —
     *   unsubscribe unused watches), or an unknown method on an older
     *   shell.
     * - `cancelled` — the call's `AbortSignal` fired (upstream outcome
     *   UNKNOWN: the tool may still have run), or, for a `host:` server
     *   only, the viewer declined the app's confirm for a call that is
     *   not annotated read-only (that call never ran). Without a signal
     *   it is only ever the latter.
     * - `rate_limited` — RESERVED: never returned today, but handle it
     *   anyway. The shell refused the call locally (the page exceeded
     *   its connector budget). Wait `retryAfterMs` (else a few
     *   seconds), retry at most once, never tighten a polling loop.
     *   Upstream throttling stays `server_unavailable`.
     * - `upstream_error` — anything else. Also the unanswered-call
     *   shape when an established shell stops replying — after the
     *   shell-announced reply budget (~130 s by default). Also a first
     *   call on a connector whose consent the viewer could not give just
     *   then (another prompt was open, or the prompt closed before a
     *   decision): stamped `retryable: true` with `retryAfterMs`, and
     *   that call never reached the connector, so re-issuing it after the
     *   wait is safe even for a write — but it is not distinguishable by
     *   shape from other retryable `upstream_error`s, so a write that
     *   must not run twice still waits for a fresh user gesture. Top-level,
     *   a page served by the platform on the artifact's own host has
     *   `window.claude`, and `use("mcp")` resolves this same namespace
     *   there only when the platform lets the artifact act as the
     *   signed-in viewer (the platform answers its calls with these same
     *   codes plus the two top-level codes below; Claude's own artifact
     *   servers are not reachable there) and `null` otherwise; any other
     *   top-level copy has no `window.claude` at all; an
     *   embedded-but-unserved frame resolves `use("mcp")` `null` within
     *   about 10 s. Gate on `use("mcp")`'s resolution, never by probing
     *   with a call.
     *
     * Lifecycle codes (from the runtime itself, not the connector path):
     * - `not_granted` — the viewer's session did not grant MCP to this
     *   frame; render the no-MCP experience.
     * - `capability_disabled` — MCP was granted but is not usable in this
     *   view (the serving runtime predates it, its module failed to
     *   load, or this boot carries no connector bridge); render the
     *   no-MCP experience.
     * - `capability_removed` — the called method is not part of the
     *   runtime serving this view; treat like `capability_disabled`.
     * - `transform_error` — the call's arguments could not be prepared;
     *   treat like `bad_request`.
     *
     * Top-level codes (only on a page served top-level on the artifact's
     * own host; never inside a viewer):
     * - `consent_required` — the viewer has not allowed this connector for
     *   this artifact there: they declined when the call asked, or the
     *   call waited about ten minutes for an answer (its "Review in Claude"
     *   notice stays up). The call never reached the connector. Render
     *   that connector's section as not allowed with a way to try again,
     *   and call again only behind a fresh user gesture: that call asks
     *   again, except that right after a decline the runtime waits out a
     *   short quiet spell (seconds, longer after repeated declines) before
     *   its notice goes up, the call waiting meanwhile; in a
     *   {@link watchTool} handler treat it as a denial — the watch asks
     *   again by itself once the viewer allows the connector or returns to
     *   the tab.
     * - `user_changed` — the account signed in on this host is no longer
     *   the viewer the page was loaded for; the runtime replaces the page.
     *   Render nothing from the call and make no further calls.
