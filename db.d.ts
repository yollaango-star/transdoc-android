/**
 * The `db` capability — a persistent, realtime document store for this
 * artifact, shared by its viewers.
 *
 * One store per artifact: JSON documents at slash-separated paths
 * (`collection/doc`, nesting deeper as `collection/doc/subcollection/doc`),
 * surviving reloads, republishes, and sessions. The store is created on
 * the first write and erased when the artifact is deleted. Reads and
 * subscriptions see other viewers' writes live. Declare
 * `capabilities: {db: {}}` — a declaring artifact is organization-internal
 * and cannot be shared publicly, so every reader and writer is a
 * signed-in member of the owner's organization.
 *
 * ACCESS RULES. By default every viewer reads and writes shared
 * documents and each viewer's own `data/users/<id>/` subtree is private.
 * To change who may read or write where, declare rules keyed on the
 * viewer's sharing level — `interact` (can interact: uses the page and
 * changes its shared data), `admin` (can edit: also publishes versions
 * and assets; the share menu's "Can edit", Editor or Manager, or an editor
 * invited by email while the artifact is not also shared by link),
 * `owner`, plus `view`, the lowest level, for paths that should stay
 * readable by everyone the server admits (every signed-in viewer of a
 * db artifact is at least `interact`, so `view` only ever widens reads,
 * never writes) — as the minimum level for each action at a path and below:
 *   capabilities: { db: { rules: [
 *     { path: "", read: "interact", write: "admin" },
 *     { path: "data/users/{self}", write: "interact" },
 *   ] } }
 * reads "anyone who can open the page reads shared data, only editors
 * write it, and every viewer writes their own subtree". A rule applies
 * to its path and everything below; a deeper rule overrides it there and
 * may be stricter or looser. A level left unset inherits from the nearest
 * rule above (the root defaults to read: "view", write: "interact").
 * An artifact created from a type often ships with that type's rules
 * already declared (commonly `write: "admin"` on shared data): read its
 * manifest before assuming the defaults.
 * Writing implies reading: a rule's write level is never below its read
 * level. A path ending in `/{self}` names each viewer's own subtree under
 * that prefix: nobody else — the artifact's owner included — sees a
 * sibling's subtree unless a rule at the prefix opens it, and `{self}`
 * must be the last segment. `{self}` works under ANY prefix, not only
 * `data/users`: "everyone reads the votes, each viewer writes only
 * their own" is
 *   { path: "votes", read: "view", write: "admin" },
 *   { path: "votes/{self}", write: "interact" }
 * with each viewer writing `votes/<their id>` (or documents below it) —
 * a rule declared AT the prefix of a `{self}` rule (here `votes`) must
 * set BOTH `read` and `write`, or the declaration is rejected at
 * publish; with no prefix rule, siblings' subtrees stay private as under
 * `data/users`. At most 64 rules; paths follow the
 * document-path grammar below. The owner meets every level, so level
 * rules never limit the owner; only `{self}` privacy does. Who holds
 * which level, in the share menu's words: "Can edit", Editor and Manager
 * hold `admin`, as does an editor invited by email (where the menu
 * offers that) unless the artifact is also shared by link. "Can
 * interact", on a person or on general access, holds `interact`, as
 * does a member of the organization who arrives by a public link. A
 * view-only member (Viewer or "Can view"; but on an older menu that
 * offers no view-only level, a person listed as Viewer and the
 * organization-wide "Can view" are `interact`) holds `view`, as does
 * every other signed-in visitor from outside the organization, by
 * public link or email invitation. A member who is a Commenter holds
 * `view` on shared data yet still writes their own `data/users/<id>/`
 * subtree; no other `view` holder writes anywhere. A signed-out visitor
 * has no data at all. So by default only `interact` and above write
 * shared documents. A call below
 * the minimum fails the same way as a sibling's `{self}` subtree: a read
 * sees a non-existent document and a write rejects `invalid_argument` —
 * so gate controls up front on what the `user` capability reports
 * (`can("data.write")` = may write shared documents under the root rule;
 * `canEdit()` = admin, for controls a rule reserves for admin;
 * `isOwner()` = owner) rather than branching on the code. When
 * `can("data.write")` resolves null, or `claude.use("user")` itself
 * does, the platform has said nothing about this viewer's write level:
 * keep shared-data inputs, and if a well-formed `set()` then rejects
 * `invalid_argument` render them read-only for the rest of the visit.
 * Rules take effect for the live version on the next call after it goes
 * live; `{db: {}}` restores the defaults.
 * AVAILABILITY is a
 * per-view fact: obtain the namespace with `await claude.use("db")` —
 * it resolves `null` when this view cannot run db (not served, not
 * granted at initialization, or failed to load) — and handle the
 * lifecycle rejection codes on calls and the `onSnapshot` error
 * callback.

/**
 * Stable error codes. Branch on `code`, never on message text; treat
 * unknown codes as `"unavailable"`.
 *
 * Store codes — the complete set for store operations:
 * - `invalid_argument` — the path, body, or query breaks a rule in
 *   the docs below (bad path grammar, non-object body, a document
 *   over 256 KiB or 32 levels deep, too many filters, an
 *   over-limit page size, ...). Surfaces at call time for verbs
 *   and on the error callback at subscribe time. Fix the call;
 *   retrying cannot succeed.
 * - `resource_exhausted` — a budget: the per-viewer call rate, the
 *   subscription cap (64 per view), too many concurrent writes or
 *   active leases, or a query that scans too many documents. Slow
 *   down, subscribe to less, or narrow the query; tightening a loop
 *   on it cannot succeed.
 * - `quota_exceeded` — a count cap is full: documents in the
 *   collection, documents in this artifact's database, or the
 *   organization's databases (the message names which, and the cap
 *   when known). Not transient: creating documents fails until some
 *   are deleted, while writes to existing documents still succeed.
 *   Surface it to the viewer; retrying cannot succeed.
 * - `unavailable` — a transient platform condition. Verbs: retry
 *   once after a short randomized delay. Subscriptions handle this
 *   INTERNALLY — delivery falls back to periodic refresh and
 *   recovers on its own; an `onSnapshot` error callback never
 *   receives it, EXCEPT when the platform bridge itself stops
 *   responding (a subscribe that never reaches the store): that
 *   listener is terminated with `unavailable` and a fresh
 *   `onSnapshot` is the only recovery.
 * - `revoked` — this view's grant was withdrawn while the page was
 *   running (access, sharing, or availability changed). Terminal for
 *   the page load: at most one delivery per listener; calls reject
 *   thereafter. Render the degraded experience; don't editorialize
 *   about why — the surrounding app owns access messaging.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO `permission-denied` and NO not-found code
 * on reads: a document this viewer cannot see behaves exactly like
 * one that does not exist (`exists: false`, omitted from queries).
 *
 * Lifecycle codes (from the runtime itself, not the store):
 * - `not_granted` — this view did not grant db to the frame.
 * - `capability_disabled` — granted but not usable in this view
 *   (the serving runtime predates it or its module failed to load).
 * - `capability_removed` — the called method is not part of the
 *   runtime serving this view; treat like `capability_disabled`.
 * - `transform_error` — the call's arguments could not be prepared;
 *   treat like `invalid_argument`.
 * (`queue_overflow`, from runtimes that queue calls made before they
 * are ready, can also reach an error callback; it is terminal for that
 * listener and falls under the unknown-code rule above.)

/**
 * PATH GRAMMAR (shared by every ref). A document path has an EVEN
 * number of slash-separated segments — the last is the document id,
 * the joined rest is its collection (`tasks/t1`, or nested:
 * `boards/b1/columns/c2`). A collection path is the odd-length
 * prefix form (`tasks`, `boards/b1/columns`). Count segments before
 * choosing the builder. `data/users/<id>` (3) is a COLLECTION — the
 * viewer's own — so one document per viewer is
 * `db.doc("data/users/" + uid + "/profile")` (4), and one document per
 * deck is `db.collection("data/users/" + uid).doc(deckId)` (4).
 * `data/users/<id>/decks` (4) is therefore a DOCUMENT path, not a
 * collection: a named per-viewer list is a subcollection under a
 * per-viewer document,
 * `db.doc("data/users/" + uid + "/profile").collection("decks")` (5),
 * each deck `.doc(deckId)` below it (6) — building from a ref like
 * this keeps the parity right for you. Segments use letters, digits,
 * and `_ - . ~ : @ +` only (never `.` or `..` alone); at most
 * 200 bytes per segment, 1000 bytes and 16 segments per path.
 * `doc()`, `collection()` and the builders on refs THROW a
 * `TypeError` synchronously for a path that breaks
 * this grammar (its message names the broken rule; for parity, the
 * segment count) — a programming error to fix where the path is
 * written, not a store condition to handle; building a ref never
 * touches the network. Paths are data you choose — there is no need to
 * pre-create a collection, and deleting a document does NOT delete
 * documents nested under its path.
 *
 * The `data/users/` path prefix is special, platform-side: each
 * viewer's own subtree under it is private per viewer — including
 * from the artifact's owner (the default `data/users/{self}` rule;
 * a declared rule at the `data/users` prefix opens siblings' subtrees
 * at its levels, see ACCESS RULES above). Address the viewer's subtree as
 * `data/users/<id>/...` using the AWAITED value of
 * {@link Claude.user.id} (declare `user` alongside `db` — without
 * the declaration `id()` resolves null; it is async, and an
 * un-awaited promise is not a valid path segment, so the builder
 * throws) — the
 * store recognizes exactly that id as this viewer, no other value
 * works. A null id means no private subtree: disable the per-viewer
 * feature for that visit rather than relocating its data to a
 * shared path; a view-only member has an id yet cannot write there
 * either, so treat a rejected write the same way. Another viewer's
 * documents under `data/users/`
 * read as non-existent (`exists: false`, omitted from queries and
 * `onSnapshot`) — the "shared by its viewers" default does NOT
 * apply inside this prefix — and a write (`set`/`update`/`delete`)
 * into another viewer's subtree rejects `invalid_argument`.
 * Hidden-until-reveal (sealed votes, planning poker): each viewer
 * writes their pick under their own `data/users/<id>/` path, where by
 * default nobody else can read it, and copies it to a shared path when
 * THEY reveal — rules are fixed at publish, so nothing a page does at
 * run time opens another viewer's subtree.
