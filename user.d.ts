/**
 * The `user` capability -- facts about the person viewing this page, and
 * about the people your shared state refers to. Obtain the namespace with
 * `const user = await claude.use("user")`; `null` (no viewer here, or the
 * view cannot run the capability) matches the all-absent defaults for
 * boolean and string reads -- `user?.isOwner() ?? false` gives the same
 * answer they would. Object reads need their own null branch: the
 * defaults' `profiles(ids)` resolves renderable entries, while a `null`
 * namespace has nothing to call.
 *
 * ONE rule for the whole namespace: every read resolves a value and NEVER
 * REJECTS -- a display string ("" when not available to this viewer), an
 * optional datum (null when not available), [] for a search, booleans false,
 * or an object whose fields follow those same rules. "Not available" covers
 * every reason at once (no viewer, scope not declared, organization policy,
 * a guest the platform gives no identity, degraded session) and there is nothing to
 * catch. The spelling is fixed: display strings (name) are "" when withheld or
 * unknown -- falsy, so `p.name || "Someone"` renders and `if (p.name)`
 * discriminates (note: ?? does NOT catch "" -- use ||); optional data (id,
 * email) is null; never an absent key, never undefined.
 *
 * Scopes gate FIELDS, uniformly, everywhere those fields appear -- me(),
 * profiles(), search() and the per-field accessors alike:
 *
 *   (nothing)                                                // isOwner, canEdit, can; me() with id/email null, name ""
 *   capabilities: { user: {} }                               // + id (yours); profiles() resolves, names stay ""
 *   capabilities: { user: { scopes: ["profile"] } }          // + names, avatars, search()
 *   capabilities: { user: { scopes: ["profile","email"] } }  // + email (yours and theirs)
 *
 * "profile" is OIDC-profile-shaped: display identity only -- it never
 * includes email. A declared scope is a ceiling, not a guarantee: any governed
 * field may still be "" / null for a given viewer (each also needs the
 * viewer's organization to allow it).
 *
 * Every viewer receives IDENTICAL HTML: these reads change what you RENDER,
 * never what a viewer can extract from source. STORE ONLY IDS -- from id(),
 * (await me()).id, or a search() hit's .id -- never a name, avatar, email or
 * Profile object: names differ per viewer, freeze at write time, and outlive
 * people. Names and emails are OTHER PEOPLE'S INPUT: set them with textContent.
