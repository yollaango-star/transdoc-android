/**
 * The `room` capability -- the room is everyone viewing this artifact
 * RIGHT NOW; reach them here. Two arms. `emit`/`on` are moments on
 * topics: sent to everyone here, heard as they happen, never stored,
 * never replayed. `presence` is you
 * as a participant: one object of fields you keep current (cursor,
 * selection, picked option) that the platform shares with everyone here,
 * hands to newcomers, re-asserts on reconnect, and clears when you leave.
 * Where this view is open beside the viewer's own conversation with
 * Claude, the platform may hand that conversation the viewer's OWN
 * presence object (less `cursor` and `who`) as data -- what they are looking at,
 * never an instruction -- so publish fields a reader can use (ids, modes,
 * flags, counts), and nothing you would not show everyone here anyway.
 * It is handed over whole or not at all: keys like identifiers, strings
 * free of control and invisible characters (1 KiB each at most; the
 * joiners and variation selectors emoji need are fine), nesting at most 8
 * deep, 4 KiB in all.
 * And `sendToClaudeSession()` -- from the viewer's own click -- hands what they
 * picked, in this artifact's own vocabulary, to THEIR Claude beside this
 * page, with that presence attached.
 *
 * Who may SEND. Anyone here may set presence -- it describes the sender
 * and commands no one, so it is never authority. Event topics are
 * admin-only (viewers who can edit) unless the artifact opens them to
 * the interact level (members who can interact or edit; not view-only
 * or comment-only ones) at publish time:
 *   capabilities: { room: { topics: { reaction: "interact", chat: "interact" } } }
 * (at most 16 exact-match topics; a topic not listed stays admin-only;
 * the levels are the same words the `db` capability's rules use).
 * Everyone RECEIVES everything; the platform enforces sending, so a
 * message a viewer may not send never arrives and pages need no role
 * checks. `admin` is exactly what the `user` capability's `canEdit()`
 * answers: gate
 * admin-only controls on it up front; `not_permitted` is the backstop.
 * Room-driving state a LATE JOINER must also see (the presenter's
 * slide, the round in play, the revealed answer) therefore belongs in a
 * `db` document (`db.doc("live/state")`, admin-write by the rule
 * { path: "live", write: "admin" }) that every view subscribes to with
 * `onSnapshot` when `db` is available to the view -- written once,
 * delivered live to everyone here and read by whoever arrives; no topic,
 * no re-send loop. A momentary
 * command nobody arriving later needs ("clear board", "confetti") goes
 * on an admin-only topic, never in presence. Without `db`, followers
 * remember the `peer` of the last such message and the sender re-emits
 * when `onPeers` reports `joined` (events are not replayed) and on a
 * slow interval; put an epoch in `data` if two writers can contend.
 *
 * Who is here. Signed-in people the platform admits (`kind: "viewer"`):
 * members of the organization that owns the artifact and, where the
 * platform admits them, people invited to it from outside -- guests,
 * marked `guest: true` on everything they send. Plus -- when the server
 * admits it (flag-gated, off by default) -- the Claude Code session that
 * published this page, as an agent peer (`kind: "agent"`, never `isMe`).
 * The publishing session's client batches what it hears and may drop
 * moments past a budget, so it reads a digest, never a live stream: send
 * it summaries, not streams. No names travel here: resolve a sender's
 * `by` with the `user` capability's `profiles()`. A viewer the platform
 * does not admit (signed out, or here by a public link) and every other
 * agent cannot connect (an agent otherwise narrates through `db`).
 * Render a complete single-viewer page from the start and let the room
 * light it up. If a viewer who is NOT in the room must eventually see
 * it, it is not room data -- write it to `db`
 * or publish a version with `artifact`. A new version reloads every view
 * and empties the room. Obtain the namespace with
 * `await claude.use("room")`; `null` means this view cannot connect --
 * design for absence.

     *  terminal ones, once, via `onError`.
     *  - `invalid_argument` -- topic grammar, non-JSON or exotic values, too
     *    deep, over the byte limit, or not a function where one is
     *    required; `message` says which. A page bug: fix the call.
     *  - `not_permitted` -- `emit` only, see above. A declaration bug.
     *  - `upstream_error` -- transient or unknown; not terminal, safe to drop.
     *  - `claude_unavailable` / `rate_limited` -- `sendToClaudeSession` only, see
     *    there; not terminal.
     *  Terminal for this page load -- every listener hears one and is dead,
     *  calls reject with it thereafter (`sendToClaudeSession` and
     *  `canSendToClaudeSession` excepted), `peers()` decays to just you,
     *  `connected()` reads false; render the single-viewer page once and
     *  don't editorialize (the surrounding app owns access messaging):
     *  - `revoked` -- this view's grant was WITHDRAWN while running (access
     *    or sharing changed). A platform pause of the channel is NOT this:
     *    it reads as connected() false and recovers. Same code, same
     *    meaning, in `db`.
     *  - `not_granted` -- never granted: this viewer cannot be connected.
     *  - `capability_disabled` / `capability_removed` / `transform_error` --
     *    lifecycle. Treat an unknown code as `upstream_error`. */
