/**
 * The `artifact` capability — artifact publish: this page writes to ITSELF

 * the platform created as a live doc (neither the page nor its declaration
 * chooses that), edits are appended instead, by `edit` or by a viewer's
 * gestures on the markup (`sync`); see those members.
 *
 * The page hands the shell a complete replacement `index.html` — or, on a
 * multi-file artifact, just the files that changed — and the shell
 * publishes it as a new immutable version of the same artifact with the
 * viewer's own authority; every open view live-reloads to it (a files
 * publish leaves the publishing view running — see {@link publish}). Obtain
 * the namespace with `await claude.use("artifact")` — `null` means this view
 * cannot run the capability; a read-only view still resolves the
 * namespace, and its write verbs surface as rejection codes
 * (`not_granted` / `not_writer`), never as `null`.

  /**
   * Failure design — read before writing any call site. A publish is a
   * write with real preconditions, and two of its failures are ROUTINE:
   *
   * - `conflict` — someone else (another viewer, or the author's own
   *   editing session) published between this page's load and this call.
   *   This is not an error state to apologize for: the shell is already
   *   reloading every open view to the winning version, so the correct
   *   handling is almost always to do nothing beyond aborting local
   *   optimistic UI — the reload delivers the new truth. If the page
   *   holds unsent viewer input worth preserving across that reload,
   *   stash it in `sessionStorage` before calling `publish` (state kept
   *   only in JS variables does not survive the reload). With `ifMatch`
   *   on a files publish, the `conflict` can have `paths` to merge from.
   * - `not_writer` — this viewer can see the page but cannot write it.
   *   Member presence does NOT signal writability (see the member doc),
   *   so a shared page should treat its first `not_writer` or
   *   `not_granted` rejection as the read-only signal: disable or hide
   *   write affordances from then on, with copy that says the view is
   *   read-only rather than that something failed.
   *
   * The rest are exceptional: branch the UX on the error `code`, never
   * on message text; retry only `upstream_error`, at most once after a
   * short randomized delay; treat `rate_limited` as a signal to slow the
   * page's own cadence (batch several changes into one publish), never
   * to retry-loop.

     *   never send it (the grant is by construction). Treat

     * that way, beside where the document puts it, is taken as the one you
     * created. One you create through `edit` but do not insert yourself is
     * inserted for you at the document's position, and one your `remove`
     * names but you leave in place is removed, so other writers' edits
     * around it can be placed — but if the parent holds, without a

     * what you passed, or an exact match elsewhere among its children, that
     * could be your own attempt: nothing is inserted for you and a later
     * edit around it reloads this view. Render it exactly, or not at all.
     * Keep the state that matters IN THE DOCUMENT (text, `data-*`
     * attributes), not in JS variables. When someone else's edit lands —
     * attributes or text on existing elements, or an element created,
     * removed or moved (e.g. Claude answering you) — it is applied to your
     * DOM in place and `document` receives a `claude:edit` CustomEvent
     * (`detail: {seq, targets: string[]}` — the data-ids touched): react to
     * it, e.g. `document.addEventListener('claude:edit', e => render())`.
     * An edit the view cannot apply in place reloads it from the document
     * and your scripts run again — so state kept in the DOM survives either
     * way. A text edit on a `<script>` or `<style>` (or on form-control/
     * metadata text such as `<textarea>` or `<title>`) is never applied in
     * place: the other views reload from the document and their scripts
     * run again.
     *
     * Rejections: `not_writer` / `not_granted` (read-only viewer — hide the
     * control), `invalid_content` (a bad op, an id that no longer exists,
     * this artifact is not a live doc, or the edit would take the document
     * over a live-editing budget — below), `conflict` (the document moved
     * under the edit — re-issuing the same call is safe), `rate_limited`
     * (slow down; batch several changes into one call), `upstream_error`
     * (the service failed OR the response was lost — the edit MAY have
     * landed: the runtime already retried once with the same idempotency
     * key, so retry yourself only with ops that are safe to apply twice —
     * `set-*`/`del-attr`/`remove` — never `create-element`, which could
     * duplicate). One call carries at most 32 ops; prefer one call per
     * user gesture.
     *
     * Live-editing budgets. An edit lands only while the page it produces
     * stays within 524,288 text characters (every text node counts —
     * `<script>`, `<style>` and data-block bodies and the whitespace between
     * tags included), 131,072 elements plus attributes (each element, text
     * run and attribute counts one), and 8 MiB rendered; an edit that would
     * cross a line is refused `invalid_content` while edits that keep the
     * page inside it still land. Two budgets only ever fill over the
     * document's life, and nothing done to the same document empties them:
     * removed content — every removed element with all that was inside it,
     * plus a small entry per removed or moved child — accumulates toward
     * 4 MiB, past which an edit that removes or moves elements is refused
     * while most other edits still land; and one parent element takes at most
     * 65,536 child placements (each child created under it or moved into it,
     * removed ones still counted). Only a new document — the live file
     * re-created, or the artifact duplicated — starts them from zero. One
     * `set-text` (or a `create-element`'s `text`) carries at most 16,384

     * `open` on `<details>`/`<dialog>`; and password / hidden /
     * payment-autocomplete inputs, whose values never enter the document.

     * inferred from the event that produced it the way React ranks an
     * update's priority. Elements a gesture creates or removes are
     * journaled as they were before: not laned, coalesced or budgeted yet.
     * (No write is dropped for leaving the document as it was — that needs
     * the document's current value per attribute, which follows in a later
     * version; a value re-set to itself is one row that says nothing.)
     * None of this costs a user a write:
     * - `discrete` — what a click, keystroke, input, change, paste or drop
     *   handler itself writes (React's discrete events, minus the ones a
     *   script can fire as trusted: a script's `focus()`, `scrollTo()`,
     *   `play()`, a dialog's `close()` or a form's `reset()` opens no
     *   gesture, and a submit, clipboard or editing-host input event the
     *   browser fires for a script call — `requestSubmit()`,
     *   `execCommand()` — counts only under the user's own activation; a
     *   form control's own input/change, a picker's or an autofill's
     *   included, always counts — so a page that drives a control through
     *   `execCommand`, or clicks its own checkbox or radio (`.click()`),
     *   is treated as the user: the event is the one typing or clicking
     *   fires, its writes journal at once and are not budgeted, and a
     *   `.click()` loop is the one way past the budget), and what `claude.artifact.sync(fn)`
     *   writes: journaled at once, never held or dropped.

     *   handler's timer, an effect, an animation loop, and — until the
     *   `continuous` lane lands — a drag's pointermove handler, a scroll
     *   handler, a hover's. Attributes coalesce 1.5 s, so a pressed class
     *   or drag-over highlight a timer puts on and takes off is ONE row
     *   with its final value, not two; and each element has a budget of 60
     *   such journaled writes a
     *   minute, past which only its latest value per attribute or text is
     *   kept and lands up to 1.5 s after the window frees — with one console warning
     *   naming it (a timer, a hot loop: mark it `data-local-*` /
     *   `<artifact-local>`). A drag or scrub therefore lands its final
     *   value, 1.5 s late; a hover class that a handler pair puts on and
     *   takes off is one row with the class cleared; and a default-lane write still waiting
     *   for its slot when a script removes or re-renders its element with
     *   no gesture behind it is dropped with the element.
     * - `idle` — `<artifact-local>`, `data-local-*`, `open` on
     *   details/dialog: never journaled.

     * latest write wins, a co-writer's applied change included.
     * So per-viewer UI — filter and search inputs, tabs, sort order, drafts,
     * expanded/collapsed chrome — goes inside `<artifact-local>` or is kept
     * on `data-local-*` attributes; everything else a viewer changes is
     * everyone's. Keep what sits inside `<artifact-local>` to the MINIMUM —
     * the controls and chrome that are genuinely per view. The served
     * document IS the artifact: it is what every other view, the watching
     * session and a read of the page see, so the content people come for
     * (the rows, the entries, the text) belongs in the shared markup, never
     * inside a local island; a page whose content lives only in
     * `<artifact-local>`, or only in what a script draws, reads as empty
     * everywhere but the view that drew it. Islands and regions nest both
     * ways (an `<artifact-sync>` element or `artifact-sync` attribute inside
     * an island is shared again;
     * the innermost marker governs), the marker elements are layout-neutral
     * (`display: contents`), and a page that marks `<body>` or `<html>`
     * itself keeps what it chose — `<body artifact-local>` makes the whole
     * page local except the regions it marks explicitly (use the attribute
     * form inside tables and lists: `<tbody artifact-sync>`).
     *
     * Two rules make it work:
     * - SERVE the content as HTML in the page; change it in event handlers
     *   however you like - in place (`li.remove()`, `el.textContent = x`,
     *   `list.append(li)`, `el.classList.toggle(...)`) or by re-rendering a
     *   container (`list.innerHTML = render(items)`): a re-render is
     *   reconciled against what it replaced (rows paired by `data-key`/`id`
     *   if you give one, else by content, else by position) and only the
     *   rows and text that actually changed are saved. What is NOT the
     *   document is markup a script renders with no gesture behind it - on
     *   load, on a timer or animation frame, after `await fetch()`: nothing
     *   of it is saved, and an element found holding such script-built
     *   children is switched OFF for the view (saving continues everywhere
     *   else): the console says so, that element gets
     *   `artifact-sync-state="off"` (style `[artifact-sync-state=off]`) and
     *   a `claude:sync-off` event bubbles from it; moving or copying such an
     *   element by gesture is not saved either. So a chart or computed
     *   summary you render from script belongs in `<artifact-local>` (the
     *   element around it then moves freely) — drawn FROM rows that stay in
     *   the document, so script enhances served content rather than standing
     *   in for it — and if you keep JS state,
     *   update it from `claude:edit` so a re-render never rolls back
     *   another writer's change. Prefer `class`/`hidden`/`data-*`/`aria-*`
     *   for state you toggle — those, `value`/`checked`, and the inert
     *   presentation names (`style`, `title`, `alt`, `placeholder`,
     *   `lang`, `dir`, `role`, `tabindex`, `disabled`, `readonly`,
     *   `contenteditable`, `open`, `colspan`, `rowspan`) patch the other
     *   views in place; any other attribute (`on*`, `href`/`src`, `id`,
     *   `type`, ...) reloads them instead.
     * - Keep each editable text in its own element (`<span>`, `<p>`, `<td>`
     *   with no child elements): text mixed with child elements cannot be
     *   saved (the console warns when a gesture produces it).
     *   `<textarea>`/`<select>` values and canvas pixels are not captured;
     *   use `<input>` / `contenteditable`, or call `edit`.
     *
     * `sync(fn)` is the deliberate exception to the gesture rule: it runs
     * `fn` (which may be async) with capture on — inputs it sets included —
     * and resolves once what `fn` changed in shared markup has been
     * appended, or rejects with the `edit` error code if it was not. For the
     * rare write with no gesture behind it (applying a poll result you DO
     * want everyone to see); its writes are always discrete. (A
     * `continuous` lane for drags, hovers and scrolls, and a `transition`
     * opt-in below discrete, follow in a later version.) Read-only
     * viewers' changes are never saved
     * (their first attempt turns capture off for the view: every region,
     * the adopted `<body>` included, gets `artifact-sync-state="off"`) — style them a read-only
     * page. A transient failure keeps the changes and sends them with the
     * next one (`claude:sync-lost` event, `{code, count}`). A change the
     * document refuses outright (an element another writer already removed,
     * a page over a live-editing budget — see `edit`), or content that cannot
     * be saved at all (text mixed with child elements, script-built elements),
     * is not queued again: `claude:sync-dropped` fires on `document` with
     * `{reason, count, targets?}` — `reason` is `"invalid_content"` for a
     * refused batch, or `"mixed"` / `"script_built"`; `targets` are the
     * data-ids the refused changes addressed (a created element's parent),
     * absent for mixed / script-built content. This view keeps the change;
     * the document does not. React with per-view state (a `data-local-*`
     * attribute, an `<artifact-local>` notice), not by rendering into
     * shared markup.
