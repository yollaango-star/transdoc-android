     *   content wants (a plain table is a `csv`, a workbook an `xlsx`);
     *   do not pre-build fallbacks to other formats.
     * - `extension_not_enabled` — the platform has switched the second
     *   list off for this view. Not the normal state: if it arrives, tell
     *   the viewer that format is unavailable here and stop — no retry,
     *   no pre-built fallback chain.
     * - `too_large` — this file is over a ceiling: an export answer
     *   (`request` set) larger than the destination the viewer chose
     *   accepts (16 MiB today), or an ordinary save over 200 MiB in a
     *   host that writes files itself (the Claude Android app). Other
     *   ordinary saves have no size limit: never cap, trim, or re-encode
     *   a download up front; on `too_large`, offer a smaller rendition.
     * - `declined` — the viewer said no (or let the prompt expire);
     *   never auto-retry.
     * - `rate_limited` — a prompt is already open or too many recent
     *   prompts; wait, then retry.
     * - `bad_request` — caller bug: bad filename (non-string or >512
     *   chars), bad/empty/detached data, a malformed `request`, or an
     *   answered export whose extension is not the requested format.
     * - `request_unknown` — `request` named no open export request
     *   (expired, already answered, or never issued to this page);
     *   nothing was saved. Drop the work; never retry with that token.
     * - `unavailable` — saves unusable in this view; hide your save UI.
     * - `not_granted`, `capability_disabled`, `capability_removed`,
     *   `transform_error` — runtime lifecycle; treat like `unavailable`
     *   (`transform_error` like `bad_request`).
